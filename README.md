# *Asteroid Runner* - Qt C++ Game
Asteroid Runner is a 2D space shooter game playable on desktop machines, with inspiration drawn from the popular 1981 arcade game Galaga. As a game created using the Qt C++ framework, the game is a culmination of everything we have learned throughout this past semester in CSE 165. 

Asteroid Runner takes place in a faraway region in space where the hero (player) has to navigate out of a dense asteroid field. The asteroids appear randomly across the top of the screen, traveling to the bottom and hurdling in the direction of the hero. 

Using the keyboard arrow keys is how the hero will maneuver the ship, and the space bar is how the hero will fire projectile lasers to destroy the asteroids and clear the path.
